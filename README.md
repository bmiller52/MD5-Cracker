# MD5-Cracker

# WARNING: This program is not intended for any illegal activity. This is only for education purposes.
#
# How to use
#
# Simply run the Python script in Terminal or Command Prompt. It will ask for the MD5 hash. Here’s a good MD5 hash generator - http://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php
#
# Then enter the .txt file name for the script to run through to find the password. I’ve included a file that has the top 1 million most common passwords. I ran through that file in about 5 seconds.
#
# Here’s a website that has basically every combination. It has over 63 million passwords. I ran through the entire thing in about 6 and a half minutes. Some computers may be slower. https://crackstation.net/buy-crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm
